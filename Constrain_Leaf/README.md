## Code used to reconstruct and constrain two-cell Sorghum leaf FBA model
1. Initial pipeline to build base sorghum model: Sorghum_ReconstructionFeb25.m and Fixing_sorghumRecon26225.m
2. Sorghum_base_Mar25.mat - Base sorghum metabolic model without constraining
3. Single cell model constraining via SC_multigene_constrain_FEB25.m and SC_pipeline_MAR25.m
4. Two_cell_model_pipeline.m - pipeline to finalize constrained model, continuing from Constrained_model_MAY25.mat
